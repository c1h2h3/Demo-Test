                    Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries 
                    from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, 
                    the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. 
                    The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable 
                    product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically 
                    steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

                <p>Coffee was initially used for spiritual reasons[which?]. At least 1,100 years ago, 
                    traders brought coffee across the Red Sea into Arabia (modern-day Yemen), 
                    where Muslim dervishes began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, 
                    the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. 
                    This beverage was known as qishr (kisher in modern usage) and was used 
                    during religious ceremonies.

                    This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. 
                    The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee 
                    is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon 
                    dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry.
